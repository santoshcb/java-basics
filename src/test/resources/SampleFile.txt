I returned from the City about three o'clock on that 
May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. 
I had been three months in the Old Country, and was 
fed up with it. 
If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have 
been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; 
but there was the fact.
